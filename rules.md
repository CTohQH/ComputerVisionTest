Data Integrity & Dataset ProtocolSource: The system shall exclusively use the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset via torchvision.datasets.Split Strategy: A stratified split must be maintained to ensure class representation across training, validation, and testing sets.Pre-processing: All images must be normalized using ImageNet mean ($[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]$) and standard deviation ($[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]$).Augmentation Policy: To prevent overfitting on the 102 species, geometric (Rotation, Flips) and color-space augmentations are mandatory.
Model Development StandardsArchitecture: Only pre-trained weights from ImageNet are permitted for initialization. Manual justification is required for the chosen backbone (e.g., ResNet vs. ViT).Reproducibility: A global seed ($42$) must be set across numpy, torch, and random to ensure deterministic results.Training Loop: * Must implement Early Stopping based on validation loss.Learning rate schedulers (e.g., ReduceLROnPlateau) must be used to refine convergence.Weights must be saved only when validation metrics improve (Model Checkpointing).
Code Quality & FormattingModularity: Logic must be separated into src/data, src/models, and src/utils. Notebooks should act as controllers, not logic repositories.Type Hinting: All functions must include Python type hints for clarity and linting.Documentation: Every function requires a docstring explaining inputs, outputs, and any specific CV transformations applied.No-Go: The use of ultralytics for classification or any AutoML black-box tools is strictly prohibited per assessment constraints.
Evaluation & ExplainabilityMetrics: A model is not "finished" until Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-scores (Weighted/Macro) are calculated.Visual Proof: Every experiment must include a Confusion Matrix analysis to identify "confused" species pairs.Interpretability: All inferences must be accompanied by a Grad-CAM or Attention Map visualization to ensure the model is focusing on floral features rather than background noise (e.g., grass or soil).
Environment & SubmissionPlatform: Development is restricted to Google Colab and local Python environments.Dependency Management: All libraries must be pinned in requirements.txt.Git Workflow: Commit messages should be descriptive (e.g., feat: implement stratified data loading).
